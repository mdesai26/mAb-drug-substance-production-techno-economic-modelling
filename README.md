# mAb-drug-substance-production-techno-economic-modelling
This study utilizes SuperPro Designer and Excel to simulate, evaluate, and analyze the **production process of monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug substances**, specifically Trastuzumab, with a focus on fed-batch manufacturing strategies. The process model aims to replicate large-scale industrial manufacturing approaches commonly used by leading biopharmaceutical companies. The study also includes an integrated techno-economic assessment to evaluate capital and operational costs.

This repository contains the following SuperPro and Excel files:

- SuperPro Designer Version 13, Build 3 Special 1000 (Intelligen, Inc.) model of the mAb (Trastuzumab) drug substance production process ("mAb_DS_production_modelling"), designed at a 20,000 L fed-batch scale, aiming to replicate the process used by major pharmaceutical manufacturers.
- The economic evaluation report generated by SuperPro Designer ("mAb_EER.LL"), detailing capital and operational cost estimates;
- The Excel file were the assumptions, techno-economic calculations and results are shown ("mAb_DS_batch_production_TEA_modelling_assumption&results.xlsx");
